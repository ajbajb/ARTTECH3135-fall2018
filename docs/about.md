This is the course website for the Fall 2018 version of ARTTECH-3135 : Interactive Art / Creative Code, taught at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
The course is heavily modeled from previous 3135 classes taught by Christopher Baker-- the class will follow basically the same structure and cover more or less the same topics,
but will include different code examples and activities, and be influenced by my interests in such areas as music and sound.
