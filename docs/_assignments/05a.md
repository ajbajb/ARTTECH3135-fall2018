__Assignment 05__
__Due: October 10, 2018__

1. Read!
    - ofBook [Sound]()

2. Code!
    - Create a class (e.g. tree, fish, unicorn, spirit animal).
    - Create at least 4 "features" to class; for example, if we were making a tree class we might include _leaves_, _trunk_, _squirrels_, etc).
    - Add any variables needed to render the features to the class (e.g. `ofColor trunkColor;`).
    - Determine how you will render the feature with simple shapes (e.g. using `ofDrawRectangle`, `ofDrawEllipse`, etc).
    - update your class to include at least two animated components.
    - Create at least 16 instances of your class, making each instance as unique as possible by setting unique values for each instance.
3. Review
    - What is a `class`?
    - How does a class differ from an _instance_ of a class?
    - What is a class constructor function?
