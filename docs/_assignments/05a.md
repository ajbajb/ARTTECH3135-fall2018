__Assignment 05__
__Due: October 10, 2018__

1. Read!
    - Nature of Code, [Chapter 2-Forces](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-2-forces/)
    - Nature of Code, [Chapter 4 - Particle Systems](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-4-particle-systems/)
    - We will be taking a look at particle systems next week, and even though the code is written for Java, the concepts are the same. These chapters will introduce some helpful equations and principles for creating an awesome particle systems.

2. Code!
    - Create a class (e.g. tree, fish, unicorn, spirit animal).
    - Create at least 4 "features" to class; for example, if we were making a tree class we might include _leaves_, _trunk_, _squirrels_, etc).
    - Add any variables needed to render the features to the class (e.g. `ofColor trunkColor;`).
    - Determine how you will render the feature with simple shapes (e.g. using `ofDrawRectangle`, `ofDrawEllipse`, etc).
    - update your class to include at least two animated components.
    - Create at least 16 instances of your class, making each instance as unique as possible by setting unique values for each instance.
3. Review
    - What is a `class`?
    - How does a class differ from an _instance_ of a class?
    - What is a class constructor function?
