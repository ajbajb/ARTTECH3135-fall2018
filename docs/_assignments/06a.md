__Assignment 06__
__Due: October 17, 2018__

Please review the code posted in Day06.
- Option 1: Create your own particle system. Have it interact with the mouse or other particles in surprising ways (perhaps by changing the physics?).
- Option 2: Pick a particle example. Add code that adds a particle dynamically (_hint_ on a mouse press or key press).
- __Bonus__ If you add too many particles, your program will begin to slow down and you will need a way to _remove_ old particles (perhaps when they leave the screen, or on a key press).  Try to add code the removes particles from your particle vector. If you get stuck, try checking the openFrameworks forum for help.      

We will be working a lot with video and camera next week. Make sure you can run simpleVideoGrabber app posted in day07 [here]([here](https://github.com/ajbajb/ARTTECH3135-fall2018/tree/master/code_day07)).  If you can not, please let me know.
