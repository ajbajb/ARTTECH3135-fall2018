__Assignment 02__
__Due: Sept. 19, 2018__

1. Read!
    - ofBook: [Animation](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/animation.html)
    
2. Create an Interactive Experimental Drawing Application
    - An experimental drawing application __should...__
        - ... allow users/participants to "draw" using the mouse.
        - ... allow users/participants to affect the "drawing" using the keyboard.
        - ... allow the user/participants to clear the screen using a keyboard command.
        - ... allow the user to save their drawing to a file (so that they could print it out on a t-shirt later)
    - An experimental drawing application __should not...__
        - ...attempt to do all of the things that existing drawing applications already do (e.g. Photoshop).
        - ... make excessive use of `ofRandom`. Perhaps try out ofNoise?
        - ... take more than a few hours to build.
    - Hold on to your code. We will talk about how to post it on github next week!
