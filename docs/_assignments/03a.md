__Due: Sept. 26, 2018__

1. Create an Animated Clock that interprets and displays time in a creative way
    - look at Golan Levin's [Banded Clock](https://github.com/ajbajb/ARTTECH3135-fall2018/tree/master/code_day03/03_clock_GolansBanded) as an example of an interpretive design.
    - take a look at the [example we made in class](https://github.com/ajbajb/ARTTECH3135-fall2018/tree/master/code_day03/03_clock00) for the technical specifics.
