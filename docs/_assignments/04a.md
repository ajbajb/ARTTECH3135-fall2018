__Assignment 04__
__Due: October 3, 2018__

1. Read!
    - Read: ofBook [OOps!](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/OOPs!.html)
        - Why? _This gives an overview of the important concept of Object Oriented Programming. We'll be covering this in class._
    - Prepare for next week.  We will be talking about:
        - Classes and Objects - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_classes_objects.htm) is recommended.
        - If you'd prefer a video tutorial over text tutorials, I'd recommend the Lynda.com tutorials [here](http://www.lynda.com/C-tutorials/C-Essential-Training/182674-2.html), specifically section 4 _Classes and Objects_.  In fact, I'd highly recommend the whole video course if you're feeling a little behind or need a bigger picture.
    - Also, other important and useful concepts:
        - Inheritance - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_inheritance.htm) is recommended.
        - Function Overloading - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_overloading.htm) is recommended.
        - Polymorphism - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_polymorphism.htm) is recommended.
        - Abstraction - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_data_abstraction.htm) is recommended.
        - Encapsulation - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_data_encapsulation.htm) is recommended.
        - Interfaces - [this tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_interfaces.htm) is recommended.

2. Code
    - Make sure you have the [clock assignment from last week](https://ajbajb.github.io/ARTTECH3135-fall2018/assignments/03a) completed
    - Review code examples from [class](https://github.com/ajbajb/ARTTECH3135-fall2018/tree/master/code_day04).

3. Review
    - What is a __range for-loop__?
    - What is `std::vector`? and how is different from a normal C-style array?
    - In reference to vectors, what do `.push_back()`, `.size()`, `.erase()` do and mean?
    - How do we get the value at a particular index in a vector?
    - What is a `class`?
    - How does a `class` differ from an _instance_ of a class?
    - What is a class constructor function?
    - What is a class destructor function?
