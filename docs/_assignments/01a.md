__Assignment 01__
__Due: Sept 12 2018__

1. Read!
    - Read: ofBook:[Graphics](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/intro_to_graphics.html);
    - Why? _You have to know how to draw!_
    - Become familiar with:
        - `ofPath`
        - some [documentation](https://openframeworks.cc/documentation/graphics/ofPath/)
        - an [example](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/master/examples/graphics/polygonExample) (this example is also in your `/examples` folder in openFrameworks, under "polygonExample");


2. Review!
    - Review this weeks [examples from class](https://github.com/ajbajb/ARTTECH3135-fall2018/tree/master/code_day01)
    - DO you know what the following terms mean?
        - _Iterating with a for-loop_([hint](https://www.lynda.com/C-tutorials/Iterating/182674/366536-4.html))
        - _Conditional statements_([hint](https://www.lynda.com/C-tutorials/Conditionals/182674/366533-4.html))
        - _Variable scope_([hint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz_W4wlP-cg) and [hint](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_variable_scope.htm))

3. Drawing Exercise!
    - Complete a digital portrait of yourself or your pet.
    - Try to show off you drawing skills with `ofDrawCircle()`, `ofDrawRectangle()`, `ofColor()`, `ofDrawEllipse()`, `ofDrawLine()`, `ofDrawTriangle()`.
    - Perhaps even with `ofDrawCurve()`, `ofDrawBezier()` or `ofPath`.
    - Don't worry about packing EVERYTHING in, and don't worry about drawing anything too realistic. Experiment and have fun.
