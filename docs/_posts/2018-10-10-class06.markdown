Hello!

just in time for the weekend :)
Code from class [here](https://github.com/ajbajb/ARTTECH3135-fall2018/tree/master/code_day06)

I removed the files that I added during class and added new ones that reflected what we covered.
Also, note the files that we did not cover in class. Feel free to look through them and let me know if you have any questions about those as well.

and to this weeks Assignment - [Assignment 06](https://ajbajb.github.io/ARTTECH3135-fall2018/assignments/06a).

Please make sure you have a github account. You will go though how to submit all the assignments, which will be by creating your own gitHub repository and posting all the assignments  in that repository.

Thanks!
