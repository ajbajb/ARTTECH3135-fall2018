Hello!

Code from class [here](https://github.com/ajbajb/ARTTECH3135-fall2018/tree/master/code_day04)

If you are updating your local class repository and you get a message telling you to "perhaps git stash":
run:
```
    git add
```
then
```
git commit -m "_your message_"
```





and to this weeks Assignment - [Assignment 02](https://ajbajb.github.io/ARTTECH3135-fall2018/assignments/04a)


Thanks!
