Hello!

Code from class [here](https://github.com/ajbajb/ARTTECH3135-fall2018/tree/master/code_day08)

and to this weeks Assignment  __Important__ _Make sure you do this!_ - [Assignment 08](https://ajbajb.github.io/ARTTECH3135-fall2018/assignments/08a).

A very helpful github instruction sheet is [here](https://github.com/ajbajb/ARTTECH3135-fall2018/blob/master/lessons2018/usingGithub.md) (some images aren't sizing correctly, but working on it!).

Please post your completed assignments in your github repo and send me the url to your repo through slack.
Each assignment should be in its own folder and each folder should be named something descriptive, for example "assignment01/digitalPortrait" (it doesn't need to be _exactly_ this, I need to know it is for assignment 01). Inside this folder should be all the necessary files.
If your repo is named "interactive_code", your file structure should look like this:

```
interactive_code/
├── assignment00_Lewitt/
│   ├── addons.make
│   ├── bin/
│   ├── config.make
│   ├── Makefile
│   ├── openFrameworks-Info.plist
│   ├── src/
│   ├── etc...
│   └── ...
├── assignment01_digitalPortrait/
│   ├── addons.make
│   ├── bin/
│   ├── config.make
│   ├── Makefile
│   ├── openFrameworks-Info.plist
│   └── src/
│   ├── etc...
│   └── ...
```

Also-- mesh examples are uploaded.

AS always, get in touch if you have any questions.


Thanks!
