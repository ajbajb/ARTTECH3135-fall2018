Hello!

Code from class [here](https://github.com/ajbajb/ARTTECH3135-fall2018/tree/master/code_day05)

I added some files to the code repo, including code that demonstrates:
    - objects that follow the mouse position
    - Don't worry, we will be looking at this example and others similar next week.

and to this weeks Assignment - [Assignment 05](https://ajbajb.github.io/ARTTECH3135-fall2018/assignments/05a).

Thanks!
