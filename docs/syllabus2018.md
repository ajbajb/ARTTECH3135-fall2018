### Course Description
This studio course investigates the creative possibilities in programming, from interactivity to information visualization. Students explore interactive narratives and games, software art, simulations and emergent behaviors, and other code-based forms. Lectures, discussions, and demonstrations provide a conceptual, aesthetic and technical foundation in programming as a creative practice.

### Course Goals

__Key goals include:__

- Intermediate working knowledge of creative coding tools and techniques.
- Working knowledge of the landscape of contemporary open source coding tools.
- Working knowledge of coding tools such as Git, Xcode, Terminal, etc.
- Working knowledge of contemporary artists and groups that shape the fields of interactive art and creative code.

### Course Values
- Sharing / Open
    - Documentation
    - [DIWO](http://furtherfield.org/projects/diwo-do-it-others-resource)
    - Publish
    - [Cult of Done Manifesto](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13)

### Methodology
Students will engage in individual in-lab and home assignments, class presentations, lectures, discussions, assigned readings, group and individual projects and desk critiques.  Visiting artists / faculty may enhance the experience and offer additional perspectives.

### Assignments
The course may include workshops and several projects, relevant technical and theoretical reading, written online responses, technical research and outings.

___

### Session 04 -- Sept 26
##### Lesson 04 -- Animation cont. collections, ofSoundPlayer
- C++
 - `std::vector`, `std::map`, collections/containers, classes
 - working with [std::map](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/stl_map.html)
 - and [std::vector](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/stl_vector.html)
 - Arrays are collections of variables.
     - In C++ we usually use a `std::vector` to hold a collection of variables.
     - We must define the contents of the `std::vector` using a template argument like `std::vector<int>` for a collection of integers.
- oF Topics
    - `ofSoundPlayer`
        - check out [BBC sound archive](http://bbcsfx.acropolis.org.uk/)
    - `ofTrueTypeFont` for typography.
    - `ofGui`


- Back to C++
    - Object Oriented Programming.  
    - OOP vs Structured Programming
        - C++ is often described as C + object oriented code.
        - Structured â†’ top down approach
        - OOP â†’ create models problem
        - Why OOP?
            - Duplicate code can be confusing and lead to bug if it is modified in the future. You will always forget something!
            - Modeling the world using objects can often be more intuitive, better differentiating between form and function.
        - Classes
            - Classes are user defined data structures.
            - Classes are reusable between programs.
            - Classes are a way to aggregate or model form (attributes) and function (methods) into reusable units.
            - Classes are often used to easily represent multiples of a complex object.
            - Classes are "extensible" through inheritance.
            - An class "instance" is an independent "instantiated" variable form of a class.
            - In the same way that an `int` is a variable type and it is instantiated by calling `int i = 0;`, a class variable type like `Ball ball1;`  Now the `ball1` variable is its own "instance" that can be manipulated.  Other "instances" e.g. `Ball ball2;` will have the same capabilities as `ball1`, but it will behave independently by default.
            - Example: Writing a class definition for a ball.
                - What are the "attributes" (that can be represented as variables) of a ball?
                    - Position
                    - Velocity
                    - Color
                    - ...
    - Some inspiration

        - [John Whitney Catalog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbV7loKp69s)

###### Readings
 - ofBook OOps!

###### Homework
- Create a custom class
- Perhaps find pattern or design in the 'real world' that you take inspiration from. For example, a pattern on stained glass, or these photographs by [Loredana Nemes](http://www.klv-artprojects.com/loredana-nemes-beyond/) or [bismuth crystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterns_in_nature#/media/File:Wismut_Kristall_und_1cm3_Wuerfel.jpg). Don't try to mimic it closely! But use it as a guide.
