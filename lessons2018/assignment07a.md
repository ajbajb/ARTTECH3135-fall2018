Read
- ofBook [Image Processing and Computer Vision](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/image_processing_computer_vision.html)

Code!
- Taking inspiration from Daniel Rozin's [mirrors](http://www.smoothware.com/danny/), from techniques talked about [in class](https://github.com/ajbajb/ARTTECH3135-fall2018/tree/master/code_day07) and from Golan Levin's [slit-scan article](http://www.flong.com/texts/lists/slit_scan/), create your own _mirror_ that interprets and manipulates your camera's pixels.
- We will set up a gallery of mirrors at the beginning of next class, tour all the mirrors and do a mini-critique.
